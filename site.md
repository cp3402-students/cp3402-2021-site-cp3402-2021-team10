The following documentation provides information for organisation and maintenance of the website. Please note: posts are best suited for gig announcements as they can fit within one page and are easy to implement and create.

To add a new page to the website, first hover over the Pages tab on the WordPress dashboard and choose the Add Page option from the pop out. This will open a new blank page in WordPress which will allow for editing. Once edits have been made, click the Publish button in the top right.

To add a new page to the menu, hover over the Appearance tab on the dashboard and choose the Menus option from the pop out. From this menu, drag the page that you want to add from the list and place it within the menu hierarchy.

To add a new post, hover over the Posts tab on the dashboard and choose Add New from the pop out. A new blank post will appear. Once edits have been made, a category can be selected for where the post is wanted to be published under. For example, newsletter posts go under the newsletter category, and posts about gigs annoucements go under the gigs category. Once completed click the Publish button in the top right.
