What is this site?

This is a working site re-design for the Townsville Jazz Club. The Jazz club is a small demographic consisting of mainly older people. They feature a range of local bands who perform at casual venues.

The current site is used for advertising this club and has features for current members as well, however, social media platforms are also used for this purpose.

This club would like to widen their audience, and with this in mind the site is designed around a few key goals: - To be extremely user friendly and simple to cater for the main audience - Intend to attract a younger audience with use of modern site design and implementations - Display as much of current content as possible

What development process was put in place?

Vagrant running a version of WP-Distillery on ScotchBox VM. This downloads a local install of WordPress and whilst running ScotchBox can be locally accessed. A live install holding the staging site and production site exists through hosting provider tsoHost. A migration plugin called all-in-one was used to merge databases between the two sites and migrate site content. This is used to keep content up to date between local and live staging sites and can then be synced with the production site through one click.
